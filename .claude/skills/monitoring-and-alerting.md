# Monitoring and Alerting

## Rules
- Define SLIs, SLOs, and SLAs
- Alert on symptoms, not causes
- Implement runbooks for common alerts
- Use dashboards for visualization

## Analysis
This skill establishes effective monitoring and alerting practices. Service Level Indicators (SLIs) measure what users care about, SLOs set reliability targets, and SLAs define contractual obligations. Alerting on symptoms (user-facing issues) rather than causes (high CPU) reduces noise and focuses on impact. Runbooks provide step-by-step remediation procedures, enabling faster incident response and supporting on-call engineers. Dashboards visualize system health and performance trends, supporting capacity planning and post-incident analysis, though they should complement rather than replace automated alerting.
