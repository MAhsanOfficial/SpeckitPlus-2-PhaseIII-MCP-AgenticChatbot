# Infrastructure as Code

## Rules
- All infrastructure defined in version control
- Use declarative configuration (Kubernetes YAML, Helm)
- Review infrastructure changes like code
- Automate infrastructure provisioning

## Analysis
This skill establishes infrastructure as code (IaC) principles for reliable, repeatable deployments. Version control provides history, enables collaboration through pull requests, and supports rollback to known-good states. Declarative configuration describes desired state rather than imperative steps, enabling idempotent operations and easier reasoning about system state. Code review processes catch configuration errors and security issues before deployment. Automated provisioning eliminates manual steps and ensures consistency across environments. IaC is fundamental to modern DevOps practices and enables GitOps workflows where Git is the single source of truth for infrastructure state.
