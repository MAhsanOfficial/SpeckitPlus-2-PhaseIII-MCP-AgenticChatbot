# Spec-Kit Plus Compliance

## Rules
- All work must reference /specs directory
- Use @specs/... references
- No assumptions outside specs
- Update specs before changing behavior

## Analysis
This skill enforces a Specification-Driven Development (SDD) workflow. By mandating that all work references the `/specs` directory and using `@specs/...` shorthand, it ensures that the specifications remain the single source of truth for the project. The "no assumptions" rule prevents scope creep and deviations from requirements, while the "update specs before changing behavior" rule ensures that the documentation and implementation remain in sync through a design-first approach.
