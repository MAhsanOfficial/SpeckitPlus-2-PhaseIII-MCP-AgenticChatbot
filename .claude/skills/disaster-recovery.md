# Disaster Recovery

## Rules
- Automate backup procedures
- Test restore processes regularly
- Document recovery time objectives (RTO)
- Maintain off-cluster backup storage

## Analysis
This skill ensures business continuity through proper disaster recovery planning. Automated backups eliminate human error and ensure consistency, running on schedules appropriate to data criticality. Regular restore testing validates backup integrity and familiarizes teams with recovery procedures, as untested backups are unreliable. Documenting RTO sets expectations and guides infrastructure decisions, balancing cost with availability requirements. Off-cluster backup storage protects against cluster-wide failures, requiring geographic separation and independent infrastructure to survive regional outages or catastrophic failures.
