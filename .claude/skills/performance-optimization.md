# Performance Optimization

## Rules
- Profile before optimizing
- Set performance budgets
- Optimize critical path first
- Monitor performance metrics continuously

## Analysis
This skill ensures data-driven performance optimization. Profiling identifies actual bottlenecks rather than assumed ones, preventing premature optimization of non-critical code. Performance budgets set acceptable thresholds for metrics like response time and throughput, triggering optimization when exceeded. Optimizing the critical path (most common user flows) provides maximum impact, following the 80/20 rule. Continuous monitoring detects performance regressions early, enabling quick remediation before they accumulate or reach production.
