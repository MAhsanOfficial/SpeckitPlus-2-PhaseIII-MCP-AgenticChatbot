# Chaos Engineering

## Rules
- Test failure scenarios in non-production
- Start with small blast radius experiments
- Define steady-state metrics before testing
- Automate chaos experiments

## Analysis
This skill builds confidence in system resilience through controlled failure injection. Testing in non-production prevents customer impact while validating failure handling. Small blast radius experiments (single pod, single node) limit risk while providing valuable insights. Defining steady-state metrics (error rates, latency) enables objective assessment of system behavior during failures. Automated chaos experiments enable continuous resilience testing, catching regressions in failure handling, though chaos engineering requires mature monitoring and incident response capabilities.
