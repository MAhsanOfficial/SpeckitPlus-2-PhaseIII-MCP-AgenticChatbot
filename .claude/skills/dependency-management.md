# Dependency Management

## Rules
- Pin dependency versions explicitly
- Regularly update dependencies for security patches
- Use dependency scanning tools
- Test updates in non-production first

## Analysis
This skill ensures reliable and secure dependency management. Pinning versions prevents unexpected breakage from automatic updates and ensures reproducible builds across environments. Regular updates address security vulnerabilities and bug fixes, though they require testing to avoid introducing regressions. Dependency scanning tools automatically identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies, enabling proactive remediation. Testing updates in non-production environments catches compatibility issues before they impact users, balancing security with stability.
