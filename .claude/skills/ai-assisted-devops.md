# AI-Assisted DevOps

## Rules
- Prefer Gordon, kubectl-ai, kagent
- No manual YAML unless unavoidable

## Analysis
This skill promotes AI-powered DevOps tooling to improve productivity and reduce configuration errors. Tools like Gordon, kubectl-ai, and kagent leverage AI to generate Kubernetes manifests, troubleshoot issues, and automate operational tasks through natural language interfaces. Avoiding manual YAML editing reduces syntax errors, enforces best practices, and accelerates development cycles. AI tools can suggest optimal configurations, validate manifests against policies, and provide context-aware recommendations. However, understanding underlying YAML structure remains important for troubleshooting and edge cases where AI tools may not provide adequate solutions. This approach balances automation with maintainability, though teams should validate AI-generated configurations and maintain version control for all infrastructure code.
