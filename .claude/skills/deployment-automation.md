# Deployment Automation

## Rules
- Automate all deployment steps
- Use declarative configuration (YAML, Helm)
- Implement automated testing in pipeline
- Enable one-click rollback

## Analysis
This skill eliminates manual deployment errors through automation. Automated deployment steps ensure consistency and repeatability across environments. Declarative configuration describes desired state rather than imperative steps, enabling idempotent operations and easier troubleshooting. Automated testing in pipelines catches issues before production, including unit tests, integration tests, and smoke tests. One-click rollback enables quick recovery from problematic deployments, reducing mean time to recovery. Deployment automation is essential for frequent releases and reduces the operational burden of maintaining multiple environments.
