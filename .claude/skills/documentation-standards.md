# Documentation Standards

## Rules
- Document architecture decisions (ADRs)
- Maintain up-to-date README files
- Include deployment instructions
- Document runbooks for operational tasks

## Analysis
This skill ensures knowledge is captured and accessible to the team. Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) document why decisions were made, preventing repeated debates and helping new team members understand the system. README files provide quick orientation to repositories, including setup instructions and project overview. Deployment instructions enable anyone to deploy the application, reducing bus factor and supporting disaster recovery. Runbooks document operational procedures for common tasks and incident response, improving consistency and reducing mean time to resolution.
