# Compliance and Governance

## Rules
- Implement audit logging for sensitive operations
- Enforce policy as code (OPA, Kyverno)
- Maintain compliance documentation
- Regular security audits and penetration testing

## Analysis
This skill ensures regulatory compliance and security governance. Audit logging creates an immutable record of who did what and when, supporting compliance requirements and incident investigation. Policy as code enforces organizational standards automatically (required labels, resource limits, security contexts), preventing non-compliant resources from being created. Compliance documentation demonstrates adherence to regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, or SOC 2. Regular security audits and penetration testing identify vulnerabilities proactively, though they require specialized expertise and should be performed by qualified professionals.
